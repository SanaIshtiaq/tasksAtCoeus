##    STE-Assignment 1 : HR POLICIES


This document is prepared in the highlights of discussion with Mr. Bilal Iqbal (HR manager) and after my thorough study of Policies’ Document given by the company’s HR department.
This document comprises of all the policies which in my opinion are most important for me.
Major types of policies are 
*	Attendance/ timings policy
*	Leave policy
*	Mobile/laptop devices policy
*	Grievance policy
Now, I am going to discuss further important policies in each type and at the end I have given my suggestions in order to make improvements in that policies and thier document.

## Policies which are important for me
##Attendance / Office Timings Policy
The policies about attendance/office timings are most important for me. As, I am a girl so office timings is an important matter for me to consider. 


### Working Days & Timing                          |
#### working days are from Monday to Friday 
 Being IT professionalist I realize that every person in this field needs rest for 2 days after working 5 continuous days in a week.  
#### Office timings are 9am  to 6pm 
 It’s quite reasonable timings for me. As, its difficult for me to stay out after magrib.  
#### Employee has to put 40hrs a week and 160hrs a month 
 By this policy i come to know that how much minimum effort i have to put in a month regardless of leaves. 
#### Lunch time 1:15pm to 2:15pm 
 It sounds good that i has one hour break. 

### Attendance Guidelines 
#### Online attendance 
 I don’t need to go through manual procedures for the attendance as, i only need to logged in to DeskTime daily by remaining on my seat. 
#### Tolerance on up to 15 minutes late arrival 
 It’s a very good policy. Because Lahore’s traffic is quite un predictable. 

### Late arrivals 
#### After 9:15 arrival will be marked late 
 I’m aware before so, I’ll not make such a mistake which results in LOP. 
#### 3 late arrivals will result in deduction of 1 CL 
 Same is the case as above. 

## Leave Policy
####There are following types of leaves which are discussed inthe document
Casual Leave (CL) , Sick Leave (SL) , Privilege Leave (PL) , Maternity Leave (ML) ,Loss of Pay (LOP)   

### Leave Year (1st July to 30th June) and applicability 
#### No leave allowed in probation period except of 2 sick leaves 
 As, I’m in the probation period so, it was very necessary for me to know. 
#### If relieved from the job in 1st-15th then not get leave credit 
 As, i know it before, I’ll not apply for whenever I’ll resign. 
#### If relieved from the job in 16th-30th then will get leave credit 
 As, i know it before, I’ll apply for whenever I’ll resign. 
#### All leaves should be approved by concerned supervisor  
 That’s important for me because it is requirement of the company. 

### Casual Leave (8 working days in a year) Entitlement & Policy 
#### No encashment of CL 
 So, I’ll keep that in mind. 
#### No more than 3 days in a row can be availed 
 If I’ll do so, that will result in the LoP 
#### Necessary to take leave through proper procedure , if not possible then notify your leader through message 
 Important for me because it is requirement of the company and also ethical responsibility. And will also result in LoP. 

### Privilege Leave (14 working days in a year ,for rest and relaxation) Entitlement & Policy 
#### PL can be granted twice in a year 
 It lets me know that i cannot apply more than twice. 
#### Any absence of more than the number of PL sanctioned will be treated under LOP 
 I’ll not exceed the limit. 
#### PL can be encashed 
 It is good news for me. 

### Sick Leave (8 working days in a year) Entitlement & Policy 
#### Named doctor’s prescription/report is required if sick leave extends beyond 2 days. 
 If i do not do so it will result in LOP. 
#### If all SLs are used then employee can avail his PL if that is also not available then LOP 
 Now i knew that how can i manage any critical health condition. 
#### Should be notified to concerned supervisor 
 It’s my ethical responsibility. 

### Loss of Pay 
#### 1 month can be availed on approval 
 If i has a list of tasks which cannot be carried out in a week or two then i can take one month without pay.
####Can be applied if employee do not have any other leave 
 Helpful in critical conditions 

### Compensatory OFF Entitlement & Policy 
#### If employee required to worked on any national holiday (official approval) then he can take compensatory off on any other working day 
 Rest is necessary for me. Or otherwise i can encash my compensatory off.

### Leave Settlement During Resignation / Retirement / Termination Policy 
#### If do not serve the notice period then will not get  PL encashment or bonuses 
 I would have to do work during the notice period.


## Laptop / Mobile Devices Policy
Laptops and mobile devices are allocated to users based upon responsibility and to key employees

### Company laptop/mobile devices guidelines 
#### In case of any damage due to any negligence by the user , 30% of the cost of the repair will be required by the user 
 So, i will pay attention to keep those devices safe.
#### In case of loss/theft employee will be required to pay  50% of the original cost of device 
 So, i will pay attention to keep those devices safe. 

### Personal Laptop / Mobile Device Guidelines 
#### Use of mobile devices for the company related work is allowed 
 I can make test  cases on my mobile phone.
#### In case of damage of devices while doing company related work , the company will bear 100% of the cost of repair 
 I’ll not hesitate to use my devices for the testing purpose. 
#### DeskTime should be installed on the laptop if employee is using his personal laptop for the work 
 Necessary for my daily attendance. 

 
## Bonus and Increment Policy
#### Increment is based upon performance.	
 In order to get higher increment i would have to do more work.
#### Bonus can be given twice in a year on the basis of appraisal and work performance. 	
 Good for the encouragement 


## Grievance Policy
Grievance policy is also important for me. According to which I’ve to discuss all my problems (regarding duties, responsibilities, subordinates, job .etc.) with my immediate supervisor and if he/she is unable to solve that then I should approach next higher position in the office and so on. 


## My Suggestions (for the improvement of policies and the document)
*	Each document should contain abbreviations and their full forms at the start of the document.
*	It should also be explained in the document that what is DeskTime and why it is used for.
*	In the policies’ document there should also be description of medical allowances and employee provident fund.
*	Grievance policy and bonus/increment policies are not mentioned in the document (these were discussed by Mr. Bilal Iqbal). So, that should also be included in the document.
*	There should also be some description on the hierarchical structure of the organization and also from which ranks an employee will go through.
*	There are two policies mentioned in the document 
	•If date of joining in-between 1st- 15th of month then eligible for the leave for that month
	•If date of joining in-between 16st- 30th of month then Not eligible for the leave for that month
	But these two rules are not applicable for the employees who are on probation period(because they can’t take any leave) , but this is not mentioned in the document.
